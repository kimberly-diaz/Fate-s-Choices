                Following your logical thinking, you head straight to the forest and mind the path below you. Its creaking noises and death-defying holes make it difficult for you to run it down smoothly instead you navigate your way around it slowly. <br /><br /><img src="../../images/chrysanthemum-flower.jpg" alt="flower" class="image-right" height="200" />

                Once on the ground, you notice to your left was the white Chrysanthemum flower but as you made your way towards it, a strange, soothing voice lulls you. It's headed to the completely opposite direction and you follow its enticing sound. <br /><br />

                Already far from the path, something smoking in the distance snaps you awake and out of the lullaby's trance. Not a single being was within the forest so far and your danger senses have been tingling... do you go towards it or go back to the path? <br /><br />

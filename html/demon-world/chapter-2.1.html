                You stay diligent in obeying mother's advice and go through the green, endless woods you've mostly only seen. This time, your skin touches with the slightly damp leaves, rustle the dirt with your shoes and shout with a loud voice. No one was stopping you now; you're free.
            </p>

            <p>
                After running for quite some time, you've seen all kinds of creatures! There were less dangerous animals like a small white, fluffy one bouncing up and down, a tall 4-legged brown one and the fluffiest rat-like creature! Then there were the largest bears you've seen wrestling around in the stream. A weird looking fish even swam by waggling its thick flat tail.

                You recognize each one from the books you've read. They've all tried approaching you before you sprint past it, then they stop following you.<img src="../../images/cliff.PNG" alt="cliff" height="200" class="image-right" />
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, you reach the edge of the land. An endless, deep cliff takes shape right after the last flower. To your right, the path continues to a wooden bridge that connects the two lands but, it's far away.
            </p>

            <p>Do you take the bridge or find another way?</p>

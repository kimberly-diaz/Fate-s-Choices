        <h1>The Story</h1>
        <p>
            You're a 13-year-old who has spent your entire life hidden from the outside world but all of this changes with a ring on the phone. A conversation that mother has been waiting many years for. After much thought, she decides to send you out to obtain a mysterious vial that will heal 'father'. He's been sick this entire time and is someone whom you've never seen before. This journey takes you beyond the houses' boundaries, past a luminous, dark oak forest to the cottage of 'Nicholas'. <br /><br />

            This is a short, non-linear, interactive story that has choices at the bottom of the page, where you, the user, will pick your desired option. Clicking will move you through the next chapter which reveals specific truths of your life, others and the two worlds, until Chapters 4/5. Once you've read until then, the ending message will appear where you are given the option to restart the game. Have fun!
